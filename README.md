**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

This Python-based project delves into the intricacies of Uber pickups in New York City, presenting an in-depth analysis through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), geospatial analysis, and an investigation into how pickup trends vary across different days of the week. Utilizing Jupyter Notebooks for a seamless blend of code, visualization, and narrative, the project offers insights into the dynamics of urban transportation with Uber in one of the worldâ€™s busiest cities.


**OBJECTIVES**

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: To uncover underlying patterns, anomalies, relationships, and trends in the Uber pickups data through statistical analysis and visualization techniques.

**Geospatial Analysis**: To map Uber pickups across NYC, identifying key hotspots and areas with lower pickup frequencies, and understanding the geographical nuances of urban mobility.

**Weekly Trends Analysis**: To analyze how Uber pickup patterns vary throughout the week, identifying peak days and times which could inform both drivers and riders about expected demand.


**DATA SOURCE**

The project uses publicly available Uber pickup datasets, focusing on data points such as pickup datetime, location coordinates (latitude and longitude), and other potentially available attributes like trip distances or durations. 


**TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES**

**Python**: The core programming language used for data processing, analysis, and modeling.
Jupyter Notebook: Provides an interactive environment that combines live code execution with visualization and narrative text, making the analysis comprehensible and engaging.

**Pandas & NumPy**: Essential for data manipulation and numerical analysis.

**Matplotlib, Seaborn, & Plotly**: These libraries enable a wide range of data visualization capabilities, from basic charts to complex geographical mappings.

**Folium**: For conducting geospatial analysis and visualizing data on maps.


**PROJECT STRUCTURE**

**Introduction**: Overview of the project scope, objectives, and datasets.

**Data Acquisition and Cleaning**: Jupyter Notebook detailing the process of fetching, cleaning, and preparing the data for analysis.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Notebooks devoted to exploring the dataset through various statistical and visualization techniques to uncover patterns and insights.

**Weekly Trends Analysis**: In-depth examination of how pickup trends vary by day of the week, identifying patterns that could influence operational and strategic decisions for stakeholders.

**Geospatial Analysis**: Analysis of Uber pickup locations across NYC, visualized through interactive maps.

**Conclusion**: Summarization of key findings, insights, and potential recommendations for Uber, drivers, and riders based on the analysis.
